Cooking Noodles
Cook noodles according to the package instructions. The noodles don't need to be cooked till al dente. Since towards the end we will be just tossing the noodles with the stir fried veggies. But if you prefer you can cook them until al dente.
Drain the water from the cooked noodles in a colander. Rinse noodles in running water very well. This method stops the cooking process.
Add toasted sesame oil to the noodles. Toss them well, so that the oil gets coated evenly on the noodles. This method gets rid of stickiness from the noodles. Cover and keep the noodles aside.
When the noodles are cooking, you can chop and grate the veggies.
Prepare corn starch slurry or paste with the cornstarch and water. Keep aside.
